This is a fully worked example based on the [Physion project](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/physics-benchmarking-neurips2021).

It contains several subdirectories that will contain standard components of the human behavioral experimental infrastructure that will support a variety of Cognitive-AI Benchmarking projects.

- `analysis` (aka `notebooks`): This directory will typically contain jupyter/Rmd notebooks for exploratory code development and data analysis.
- `experiments`: If this is a project that will involve collecting human behavioral data, this is where you want to put your experimental code. If this is a project that will involve evaluation of a computational model's behavior on a task, this is also where you want to put the task code.
- `results`: This directory is meant to contain "intermediate" results of your computational/behavioral experiments. It should minimally contain two subdirectories: `csv` and `plots`. So `/results/csv/` is the path to use when saving out `csv` files containing tidy dataframes. And `/results/plots/` is the path to use when saving out `.pdf`/`.png` plots, a small number of which may be then polished and formatted for figures in a publication. *Important: Before pushing any csv files containing human behavioral data to a public code repository, triple check that these data files are properly anonymized. This means no bare AMT Worker ID's.* It is generally recommended that "raw" behavioral data be stored in a database rather than as part of this repo.
- `stimuli`: This directory is meant to contain any download/preprocessing scripts for data that are _inputs_ to this project. For many projects, these will be images. This is also where you want to place any scripts that will upload your data to our `stimuli`  MongoDB database and any image data to Amazon S3 (so that it has a semi-permanent URL you can use to insert into your web experiment.)
