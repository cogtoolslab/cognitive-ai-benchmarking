# Overview

The purpose of this repo is to provide a starting point for researchers planning to conduct a Cognitive-AI Benchmarking (CAB) project. 
A CAB project will typically combine three elements: (1) stimulus generation; (2) human behavioral experiments; (3) analysis of behavioral data and comparison to model outputs. 

The examples here are adapted from the [Physion project](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/physics-benchmarking-neurips2021).

Three different modes for using this repo:
- Level 1: Example client-side JavaScript code for prototyping tasks quickly
- Level 2: Example integration with node.js server for hosting your experiment and writing data to file without a database
- Level 3: Example integration with an already running mongodb server

# Installation

## cabconfig

To configure your environment for using CAB, you will need to create a config file called `.cabconfig`. 
The purpose of this file is to define variables that apply to all of your CAB projects (e.g., username and password to access the mongo database).
By default, this config file should be saved as a hidden file in your home directory, with file path `HOME/.cabconfig`.
If you want to store this file in a different location, you can specify the path by setting the enviroment variable `CAB_CONFIGFILE` to the desired path.

Here is an example of a `.cabconfig` file, which follows the [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) file format.

```
[DB]
password=mypassword #required
username=myusername #optional, default if unspecified is "cabUser"
host=myhost #optional, default if unspecified is 127.0.0.1
port=myport #optional, default if unspecified is 27017
```

# Implementing your experiment

## preparing stimuli
- Uploading your stimuli to S3. 
- Assumes that you have already generated your stimuli elsewhere.

## designing task user interface
- getting acquainted with jsPsych
- 

## configuring experiment according to research design
- creating and uploading the experiment config (including projName, expName, iterationName)
- splitting and batching trials into sessions
- defining the criteria by which a session is valid.

## launching your experiment on a web server


If you want to test your experiment on the server but don't want to worry about MongoDB, you can do the following:

First, create a directory in the `stimuli` folder specified by your database name and collection name (e.g. `stimuli/BACH/dominoes/`). 

Then run the `generate_metadata.ipynb` jupyter notebook to generate your stimuli and save the is as a `.json` file in the directory you just created.

Next, run `node app.js --gameport PORT --local_store`. This needs to be ran from the experiments folder (ie. do `cd experiments` before running this).

This should be it! When you try out the experiment, your data will be saved on the server (as opposed to MongoDB) in the direcotry: `results/databaseName_resp/collectionName.csv` (e.g. `results/BACH_resp/dominoes.csv`) that you can check and help you debug.

## validating data input and output
- stimuli being correctly read in
- verify that all trial metadata and response variables are being read out 
- monitoring which sessions are valid on an ongoing basis ("watchdog")

## analyze experiment outputs 
- construct visualizations of response variables w.r.t. key axes of variation in trial metadata
- verify that experiment 

## post your experiment to a recruiting platform (e.g., Prolific)

It contains several subdirectories that will contain standard components of the human behavioral experimental infrastructure that will support a variety of Cognitive-AI Benchmarking projects.

- `analysis` (aka `notebooks`): This directory will typically contain jupyter/Rmd notebooks for exploratory code development and data analysis.
- `experiments`: If this is a project that will involve collecting human behavioral data, this is where you want to put your experimental code. If this is a project that will involve evaluation of a computational model's behavior on a task, this is also where you want to put the task code.
- `results`: This directory is meant to contain "intermediate" results of your computational/behavioral experiments. It should minimally contain two subdirectories: `csv` and `plots`. So `/results/csv/` is the path to use when saving out `csv` files containing tidy dataframes. And `/results/plots/` is the path to use when saving out `.pdf`/`.png` plots, a small number of which may be then polished and formatted for figures in a publication. *Important: Before pushing any csv files containing human behavioral data to a public code repository, triple check that these data files are properly anonymized. This means no bare AMT Worker ID's.* It is generally recommended that "raw" behavioral data be stored in a database rather than as part of this repo.
- `stimuli`: This directory is meant to contain any download/preprocessing scripts for data that are _inputs_ to this project. For many projects, these will be images. This is also where you want to place any scripts that will upload your data to our `stimuli`  MongoDB database and any image data to Amazon S3 (so that it has a semi-permanent URL you can use to insert into your web experiment.)
